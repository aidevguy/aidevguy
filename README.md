- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @aidevguy
  I have an extensive career in software development, primarily in yucky and boring business related stuff. I would say that I have an advanced understanding of Object Oriented programming, unfortunately the language of my expertise is no common - ABAP.
I worked at SAP for years and, also unfortunaley, had the displeasure of working under architects the were either German, aloof, and completely incompetent or were nice enough people but had little or no understanding of OO Principles or design and
deferred to the German on all decisions. Most unfortunate of all is that I did not have the courage to leave and pursue better opportunities elsewhere, as none were available within the company. After being laid off, I have found a much better position
at a startup, working with same skill, as well as new ones, but still have an itch to scratch.

I‚Äôm interested in AI Development, Python, writing, and reading.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about how large language models work and can be adapted to specific needs. In fact, there is a possibility of this becoming a micro-language-model exploration.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on automation of text output from language models such as gpt2-xl into AI Voice Generation via TTS - such a tortoise tts ( if it ever becomes stable and useable in many environments )
- üì´ OnlyFans or Patreon are not good ways to reach me. For now, don't call me, I'll call you! No, I don't have feet pics, so don't ask! ;)

The first mission of this repository is to provide solutions for others like me who are learing the basics of running this stuff on home pcs and encounter problem after problem getting other people's stuff to work. One of the most common
gripes I have is that people who write tutorials don't go back and try to follow the steps on a "fresh" install or they do not realize their level of knowledge might cause them to leave something out.

Here are some examples I have encountered which make this journey very difficult:
1) Code bases from repositories do not work.
   Example: I spent time and bandwidth setting it up in windows, then run it and get a message that some dynamic compile is not supported in windows.
            
2) Something works, then suddenly stops with an error which essentially means "index out of bounds"
3) "Next Steps" mentioned, but not explained.
   Example: "You can make this better by finetuning the model."

I hope to make this journey as painless as possible, but am completely new to all of this. 

Most importantly, if you see something, say something. I am 100% open to constructive feedback and suggestions on how to improve. I'm even OK with "That code is horrible!", provided you follow it up with "This is how REAL code is written: <your code here>"
